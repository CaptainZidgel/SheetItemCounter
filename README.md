# SheetItemCounter
Ok so a few months ago my mom needed to check the occurences of items in a spreadsheet column. We spent an hour and a half counting them all by hand and triple checking for accuracy.
This program does that automatically. (This could've been a command line program. Would only take 5 minutes to cobble together, but I wanted it to be usable by Generation X! and also GUI experience)
GUI made with Tkinter (The question: why didn't I use Java for this?? Making GUIs for that is so much easier!! The answer: stubbornness!)

# so is it done?
It's functional. The GUI is about as function as I want it to be. It's 99% error foolproof (unless you try to work without a spreadsheet I suppose), but I don't really care to put more work into it.
I hate Tkinter now. My next step will probably be recoding it in Java or Jython for experience, learning, and beautification of the program.
