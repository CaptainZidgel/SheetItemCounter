# SheetItemCounter
Ok so a few months ago my mom needed to check the occurences of items in a spreadsheet column. We spent an hour and a half counting them all by hand and triple checking for accuracy.
This program does that automatically. (This could've been a command line program. Would only take 5 minutes to cobble together, but I wanted it to be usable by Generation X! and also GUI experience)
GUI made with Tkinter (The question: why didn't I use Java for this?? Making GUIs for that is so much easier!! The answer: stubbornness!)

# it's not done yet.
its functional, but it needs the GUI to be fixed. (Currently it's **VERY** wonky). It also doesn't have any try/handle for errors. So just don't do anything to throw an error!
